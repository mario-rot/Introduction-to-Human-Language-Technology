    "By performing this practice it is possible to observe the metrics useful to compare the similarity between text blocks. To obtain good results it is necessary to isolate the text in simpler parts by using a tokenization method, the precision of this part of the process is fundamental to obtain divisions that preserve the sense in each of the compared texts. Once tokenization has been applied, it is possible to use Jaccard's distance to compare the similarity between the blocks of text obtained, although it is not the only one, since other distance metrics can be used to evaluate the relationship between the sentences being compared. Finally, it is possible to use Pearson's correlation as a global metric that evaluates the performance of the algorithm to complete the task. In this exercise, the Pearson correlation was 0.4504, which indicates an acceptable result, although it could still be improved by applying more complex strategies. \n",
